	video_sum(V): 
		Get info of videos, Get mapping from channel to video
	channel_sum(Cdata, VC_dict): 
		get info of sampled channels
	Clustering(C, K): 
		Apply KMeans clustering on channel data and return statistics of clustering result, K is number of clusters
	PCA(C_stat, C): 
		Get the PCA representation of quantitation of channel popularity
	Cgen(C, C_stat, C_des, C_title, C_pubtime, V_stat, V_comm, VC_dict):
		Generate part of channel features including (as matrix mat):
			Duration, video publishing frequency
			Ratio of subscriber/view, comment/view
			Sentiment anaylysis result: positive/negative/neutral/compound sentiment scores
		Generate response vector y according to clustering result:
			cluster1: [0, 850000000], cluster2:[850000000, 3700000000], cluster3[3700000000, infinity]
	Vgen(V_stat, VC_dict):
